this is a helper subclass for the Start App ad platform.
I wrote this to have a simple way to handle showing ads through a static method like most ad platforms allow. 
Unfortunately StartApps developers thought this was too difficult to do, so I have implemented it for them.

Now in your app delegate, initialize interstitial ads with

[STAStaticStartAppAd setupWithAppId:@“appId” andDevId:@“devId”];

and show ads where ever you like with

[STAStaticStartAppAd showAd];
